Files: 
CNN_Image trains the CNN model
trained_plant_disease_model.keras is a model generated after training the Model 
streamlit_Cdoe_ml in the file uses streamlit library to create a dashboard to display sensor data and the health status of the leaf
plants_2 --> Folder is used for saving Dataset in the folders. 

Instructions to run the code:
1.run the command "python CNN_Image.py" --> To train the model 
2. Ones the CNN_Image_Interactive file is generated by the model run the command" python -m streamlit run streamlit_Cdoe_ml.py" to View the dashboard.


ALTERNATE WAY OF TRAINING MODEL (Auto ML) 

We have also implemented alternate way to train the model by using Auto ML  .
Following is the link to model deployed in Vertex AI Auto ML tool
